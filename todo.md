cba Elements Maintenance TODO list
---

The following is a running list of the open items to be addressed in the application.  These are mostly simple things I want to remember to get to and not necessarily bugs that require tracking in a bug tracker (though I cannot guarantee a bug or two won't make this list).

----

* On the Elements form, disable resize without hiding the title bar.
* The Elements form need a .css to decorate it.
* The Exit, Help, and Maintenance buttons need actions.
* Obtain and save the host name using InetAddress.GetLocalHost().GetHostName()
* Update the DataModel to reflect the changes in the elements table
