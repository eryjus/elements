cba Elements Maintenance TODO list
---

The following is a running list of the open items to be addressed in the application.  These are mostly simple things I want to remember to get to and not necessarily bugs that require tracking in a bug tracker (though I cannot guarantee a bug or two won't make this list).

* On the Login form, make the Sign In button the default action on enter.
* On the Elements form, the help button shifts on hover.
* On the Elements form, disable resize without hiding the title bar.
* The Elements form need a .css to decorate it.
* The Exit, Help, and Maintenance buttons need actions.
* The Maintenance button needs a text label.
* The open application is not blank on entry.
* Obtain and save the host name using InetAddress.GetLocalHost().GetHostName()
